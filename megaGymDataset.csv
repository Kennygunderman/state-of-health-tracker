Both swing variations work many of the same muscles, such as the hamstrings, glutes, and core, but because the weight must travel farther in the overhead swing, it's slightly more metabolically demanding and works the upper back and shoulders more. This combo can be performed for time or reps and works especially well in circuit-style or full-body training. If you can't perform the overhead swing without lower back or shoulder pain, just perform the chest-height swing.",Strength,Abdominals,Kettlebells,Intermediate,,
